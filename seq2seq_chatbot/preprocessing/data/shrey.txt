okay a rough day once in a while is fine.

everybody faces challenges and its not just you. Think of it as a bad time that will go after some time.
> thats what keeping me alive until now.
have you tried to talk to your family and friends about your experiences and feelings
> i feel they would start worrying about me. I dont want them to think of me as a sad depressed person.
I would never judge you for being depressed. I understand it’s outside of your control, and I’m here to help if I can.
> the thing is it really hard to open to someone about you being sad for no reason.Its difficult to explain to your friends
 and family about this heavy feeling in your chest for no reason. I dont understand why i am even depressed.
I can’t understand what you are going through, but I’m here for you.Please just know that when you need to talk I’m here.
>okay, i think i want to leave now.
have you tried to talk to your family. With my experience involving in community is the best way to win over these feelings.If you need space I understand, but please know you can talk to me anytime, day or night
